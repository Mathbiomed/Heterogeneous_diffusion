# Heterogeneous_diffusion


This is a MATLAB code for the paper "Beyond microtubules: The cellular environment at the endoplasmic reticulum attracts proteins to the nucleus, enabling nuclear transport" by Chae et al. (2023) submitted in Science.
The code simulates the protein diffusion in a heterogeneous intracellular environment with physical interaction with the ER.
